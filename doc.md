# How To Build a Full Featured, Event Driven, Notification Service With Spring Boot and Redis

# Introduction 
An event can be defined as an action or status change, that can be observed and further trigger subsequent actions to complete a given task.
At the very base of event driven system is the concept of producing events and listening for said event to make an informed decision on what to do next.
One way of achieving/implementing event driven architectures is by using PUB/SUB event buses/or protocols to communicate between services.
Event driven systems are highly scalable as they reduce the load of having to get immediate responses for each request.

# What You'll Learn
